# Animal-Adoption-Analysis

Overview:
This project explores the factors influencing animal adoption rates in shelters across the country. 
The goal is to identify trends and characteristics that affect an animal's likelihood of being adopted, such as breed, color, age, and type.
The findings can help shelters focus efforts on animals that may need extra attention to find their forever homes.

Objectives:
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover adoption trends.

Dataset:
The dataset contains 90k records of animal intake and adoption outcomes, including the following features:
outcome_type: Outcome of the animal (e.g., adopted, transferred).
age_upon_intake: Age of the animal upon shelter intake.
age_upon_outcome: Age of the animal at the time of outcome.
animal_type: Type of animal (e.g., dog, cat).
breed, color: Breed and color of the animal.
intake_condition, intake_type: Condition and type of shelter intake.
sex_upon_intake: Sex of the animal upon shelter intake.
datetime, outcome_year: Date of intake and outcome year.

Tools and Technologies:
Python: Data cleaning, EDA, and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Documenting the analysis process.
Pandas: Data manipulation.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: Initial exploratory visualizations.

Methodology
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values through imputation or exclusion.
Normalize categorical values (e.g., breed standardization).

EDA:
Analyze distribution and relationships between features.
Identify characteristics of animals that are more or less likely to be adopted.

Deliverables:
Jupyter Notebook: Contains documented EDA and insights.

Actionable Insights:
Characteristics that increase adoption likelihood.
Recommendations for shelters to prioritize animals needing extra support.

Insights and Impact:
The analysis highlights actionable insights for shelters, such as:
Specific breeds or colors that require extra marketing efforts.
Age groups that are less likely to be adopted quickly.

Future Work:
Incorporate additional datasets, such as shelter-specific funding data.
